Each student begins with four late days that may be used throughout the quarter. You may submit this assignment 24 hours late by using one late day or 48 hours late using two late days. No submissions will be accepted more than 48 hours after the due date without prior approval by the head TA. See the syllabus for more information about our late policies.

All due dates and submission times are expressed in Pacifc time.

You are permitted to work on this assignment in pairs.

Linked structures are a fundamentally diferent way of encoding sequences than the array-based approaches you worked with on Assignment 5 and Assignment 6. This assignment is all about manipulating, traversing, and exploring linked structures. It’s a three-parter. The frst part is a hybrid coding/debugging exercise where you’ll work the debugger to escape from a maze. The second part is a warm-up exercise intended to get you playing around with doubly-linked lists. The third part is a coding exercise in which you’ll use linked lists to build a system that can be used to make nifty 2D graphics.

You know the drill – make consistent, slow, steady progress on this assignment rather than doing everything at the last minute. Here’s our recommended timeline:

Aim to complete The Labyrinth! within two days of this assignment going out. Aim to complete Doubly-Linked List Warmup within two days of this assignment going out.



Aim to complete Particle Systems within seven days of this assignment going out.

Getting Help

Keep an eye on the Ed forum for an announcement of the Assignment 7 YEAH (YEAH = Your Early Assignment Help) group session where our veteran section leaders will answer your questions and share pro tips. We know it can be daunting to sit down and break the barrier of starting on a substantial programming assignment – come to YEAH for advice and confdence to get you on your way!

We also here to help if you get run into issues along the way! The Ed forum is open 24/7 for general discussion about the assignment, lecture topics, the C++ language, using Qt, and more. Always start by searching frst to see if your question has already been asked and answered before making a new post.

To troubleshoot a problem with your specifc code, your best bet is to bring it to the LaIR helper hours or ofce hours.
